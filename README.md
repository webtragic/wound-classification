#Abstract

Chronic wounds have emerged as a significant medical challenge due to their adverse effects, including infections 
leading to amputations. Over the past few years, the prevalence of chronic wounds has grown, thus posing 
significant health hazards. It is now becoming necessary to automate the wound assessment mechanism to 
limit the dependence of healthcare practitioners on manual methods. Therefore, a need exists for developing an 
effective wound classifier that enables practitioners to classify wounds quickly and reliably. This work proposed 
Eff-ReLU-Net, an improved EfficientNet-B0-based deep learning model for accurately identifying multiple categories 
of wounds. More precisely, we introduced the ReLU activation function over the Swish in our Eff-ReLU-Net because 
of its simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. Additionally, we introduced three fully connected dense layers at the end 
to reliably capture more distinct features, leading to improved multi-class wound classification. We also employed 
augmentation approaches such as fixed-angle rotations at 90°, 180°, and 270°, rotational invariance, random 
rotation, and translation to improve data diversity and samples for better model generalization and combating 
overfitting. The proposed model’s effectiveness is assessed utilizing the publicly available AZH and Medetec 
wound datasets. We also conducted the cross-corpora evaluation to show the generalizability of our method. The 
proposed model achieved an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 92.33%, 97.66%, 95.33%, and 96.48% on 
Medetec, respectively. However, for the AZH dataset, the attained accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are 90%, 
89.45%, 92,19%, and 90.84%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposed Eff-ReLU-Net 
method for classifying chronic wounds.
